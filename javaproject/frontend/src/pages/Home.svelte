    <h1>Welcome to my Fruit-Classifier</h1>
    <p>For my project, I use a Fruit-Dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyapmaher/fruits-dataset-images" >Kaggle</a>.</p>
    <p>The dataset consists of 9 different fruits. But since Chickaroo and Kiwi are very similar in shape and color, I decided not to use Chickaroo. The reason behind it is, that it is more difficult to model objects with several similar features.</p>
    <p>For the modelling process I used a Convolutional Neural Network with an Input-Layer, two Hidden-Layers, a Dense-Layer and an Output-Layer. As Activation-Function, I use 'Relu'. The inspiration for my Neural Network I got from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/khushijoshi12344/fruit-dataset-image-classification-cnn">Python-Code on Kaggle</a>.</p>
    <p>Please try out my Fruit-Classifier in the other <a href="#/classifier">Tab</a>.</p>
